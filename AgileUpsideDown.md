# Need / Business Case
The best people to solve a problem are those who deal with the consequences. This is the foundation of innovation. However, the necessity alone is not enough. We also need to create space, provide resources and culture for innovation to thrive. 

In an ideal world, innovative ideas could be worked on immediately, but that is rarely the case. No matter how lean our processes are, there will be an overhead. You will need to convince people of your ideas, write things down and get them through your funnel. 

Agile upside down is a ceremony that is designed to overcome these obstacles, by creating space & providing resources for people to be creative.

# What is Agile Upside Down?
As the name suggests, we flip the responsibilities of the agile team on its head. There are no roles, there is no one to convince or prioritize topics. Everyone is free to work on what they desire, with no obligation to even finish. 

The rules are simple:
- Whatever you work on, needs to be somehow related to what the team does. Be it technology, be it retrospectives, be it ways of working, be it introducing a new tool. It just has to do _something_ with what you produce or how you produce it.
- No one needs to approve anything that you do. You are free to pitch your ideas and get people to join you though.
- At the end of the event, everyone presents what they worked on or learnt.
- Have fun!

# Still not convinced? Here are somethings my teams produced in 2 days:
- Created a mobile friendly custom UI for our build monitors and other dashboards. This let them monitor the errors, warnings, time taken etc. during their commute. 
- Team building workshops with Legos. Accelerated team forming.
- Showed how our codebase would be better as a monorepo, with working demo!
- Challenged and did workshop with the product owners on why certain features and services could and should be killed.
The list goes on and on!

# Tips
- Do it in a cadence, I propose 3 days every quarter to start with.
- Collect ideas to work on continuously. This prevents recency bias and also creates excitement for the event.
- Do it as an in-person offsite if possible. This lets you also work on social activities
